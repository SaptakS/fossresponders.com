**Last updated: April 20, 2020**

FOSS Responders collect the bare minimum of personal data necessary, and we do not sell or mine your data or share it for any reason - except to safely provide information and resources to you.

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by fossresponders.com ("FOSS Responders" or “we”). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites and online services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us. 

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification).

## Collection of Information

### Information You Provide  
We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you fill out a form, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
