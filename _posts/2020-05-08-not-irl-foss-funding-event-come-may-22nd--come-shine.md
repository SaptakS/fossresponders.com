On Friday, May 22nd, FOSS Responders will host a virtual event to provide financial support for organizations affected by the profound disruptions -- to our economy and our community -- of Covid-19.

The [Virtual FOSS Responders Funding Event](https://opencollective.com/foss-responders/events/virtual-funding-event-q2-2020-4edd1e3a) is designed to help support the open source community through this critical time. Conference cancellations have caused financial loss, unmet fundraising trajectories, and missed business opportunities. Now is the time to participate in the sustainability of open software organizations. Now is the time to be a part of its survival. 

Limited Zoom invites available! **Join us as an applicant, sponsor, mentor, or supporter.** We want this to be a time of togetherness, mentorship, camaraderie (and commiseration), and a virtuous cycle of support! 

### You are as welcome as the flowers in May.     

Whether you are an organization planning to sustain in an uncertain future, a company that wants to step up and hold our community together, and/or you’re a mentor with a passion to give during such unprecedented times, we want you to be part of our FOSS Responders Funding Event.
