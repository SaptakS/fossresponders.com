We are excited to announce that UPLIFT! by FOSS Responders is just around the corner! The whole team, all 90+ of us, were blown away by the community’s support. We had 17 organizations apply for COVID-19 related support and funding.

For the event, we narrowed the organizations down to ten:

* Apache Software Foundation
* Drupal Association
* Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
* FOSSASIA
* Free Software Foundation
* GNOME Foundation
* Open Source Matters, Inc.
* Participating Organizations
* Plain Schwarz/Berlin Buzzwords
* Python Software Foundation
* Tor Project

The FOSS Responders team is ecstatic to announce that in partnership with [name all partner orgs], we’ll be distributing over $100,000 USD to the participating organizations!

However, we’re not done yet! We’re also inviting event participants to donate. Indeed has committed to match participant donations up to $5,000 USD. Donations and matched funds will be distributed equally to the participating organizations.

###  Honorable Mentions

We had more applications than space, and we’d like to shine a light on those organizations that were not selected to participate in the UPLIFT! event. Their applications will be reviewed in a second round by the FOSS Responders’ general organization committee for future support opportunities. We encourage you to support these great organizations.

* DemocracyLab
* Open Labs Albania
