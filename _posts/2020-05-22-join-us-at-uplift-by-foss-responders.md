We are excited to announce that [UPLIFT! by FOSS Responders](https://opencollective.com/foss-responders/events/virtual-funding-event-q2-2020-4edd1e3a#section-participants) is just around the corner! The whole team, all 90+ of us, were blown away by the community’s support. We had 17 organizations apply for COVID-19 related support and funding.

For the event, we narrowed the organizations down to ten:

* [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html)
* [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association/donate)
* [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-4)
* [FOSSASIA](https://community.fossasia.org/donation/)
* [Free Software Foundation](https://my.fsf.org/donate/)
* [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/support-gnome/donate/)
* [Open Source Matters, Inc.](https://www.joomla.org/sponsor.html)
* [Plain Schwarz/Berlin Buzzwords](https://berlinbuzzwords.de/tickets)
* [Python Software Foundation](https://staging.python.org/psf/donations/)
* [Tor Project](https://donate.torproject.org/)

The FOSS Responders team is ecstatic to announce that in partnership with many organizations listed below, we’ll be distributing over $100,000 USD to the participating organizations!

However, we’re not done yet! We’re also inviting event participants to donate. Indeed has committed to match participant donations up to $5,000 USD. Donations and matched funds will be distributed equally to the participating organizations.

###  Honorable Mentions

We had more applications than space, and we’d like to shine a light on those organizations that were not selected to participate in the UPLIFT! event. Their applications will be reviewed in a second round by the FOSS Responders’ general organization committee for future support opportunities. We encourage you to support these great organizations.
