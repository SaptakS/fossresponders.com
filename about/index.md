Open source software depends upon real-world interactions just as much as it does on code. With the alarming spread of the Coronavirus, the open source ecosystem is being affected in enormously impactful ways. This site is one of many efforts to help.

It started as an organic movement led by Duane O'Brien and others. We're open to all who can helping out!
