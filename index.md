Have something else you need? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/foss-responders/support-requests/issues/new), [join our Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com/#crisis-working-group) or email [foss-responders@googlegroups.com](mailto:foss-responders@googlegroups.com). If you'd rather email than open a GitHub issue, please feel free to email, as well.

## Conferences

- Here is [a dynamic list of cancelled events](https://airtable.com/shrETNURgXNrGWbd8/tblc49hMMykARebo8).
- If you were sponsoring a cancelled conference for recruitment purposes and you still want to connect with prospective candidates, Indeed is working on scheduling virtual hiring events. [Click here for more information](https://events.indeed.com/hiringevents/#get_started_form).

What else should be here? Get in touch!


## Funding

- **Reverse Scholarships**: If you are an open source maintainer, and you paid for a ticket or for travel to an important conference that was cancelled, [please get in touch](mailto:foss-responders@googlegroups.com). We are actively looking for people to help out with funds, but need to know if people need it before activating our networks to help you cover your costs.
- [Indeed](https://indeed.com) is running another round with $10k to focus on projects impacted by COVID-19. They're looking for others to join in organization, sponsorship, mentorship, and outreach. [Get in touch](mailto:foss-responders@googlegroups.com).

## About

<p class="center"><a href="https://slack.opencollective.com/#crisis-working-group"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-open%20collective-blue" alt="Slack link to Open Collective Slack"/></a></p>

Open source software depends upon real-world interactions just as much as it does on code. With the alarming spread of the Coronavirus, the open source ecosystem is being affected in enormously impactful ways. This site is one of many efforts to help.

## Other Efforts

While not dedicated entirely to open source, here are some other programs that need help

* [Covid19 Response Fund](https://covid19responsefund.org/). Donate directly to the WHO, who will allocate funds to efforts that need it.
* [Portland Corona Virus Mutual Aid Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/portland-corona-virus-mutual-aid-fund). Donate to those in Portland who need help.
